# Utility-Oriented-String-Indexing
This repository contains the implementation of two experiments addressing the Utility-Oriented String Indexing (USI) problem. The USI problem focuses on preprocessing a string with numerical utilities into a compact data structure, enabling efficient computation of the global utility of query patterns based on their occurrences and associated utilities. This approach supports fast and scalable analysis of large datasets.

The two experiments included are:

1. Top-K Frequent Substring Mining: Algorithms to identify the K most frequent substrings in large datasets.
2. USI Problem: Techniques to preprocess strings with utilities into efficient data structures for querying pattern utilities.

# Requirements
- A GNU/Linux system
- A modern C++17 ready compiler
- This project requires the installation of the [SDSL-lite](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite) library.
